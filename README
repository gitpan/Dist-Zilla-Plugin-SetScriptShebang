NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::SetScriptShebang - Set script shebang to #!perl

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.01 of
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::SetScriptShebang (from Perl distribution
    Dist-Zilla-Plugin-SetScriptShebang), released on 2014-08-16.

SYNOPSIS
    In "dist.ini":

     [SetScriptShebang]

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin sets all script's shebang line to "#!perl". Some shebang
    lines like "#!/usr/bin/env perl" are problematic because they do not get
    converted to the path of installed perl during installation. This
    sometimes happens when I package one of my Perl scripts (which uses
    "#!/usr/bin/env perl") into a Perl distribution, and forget to update
    the shebang line.
